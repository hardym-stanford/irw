## Psychiatric diagnoses of n=30 patients provided by different sets of m=6 raters. Data were used by Fleiss (1971) to illustrate the computation of Kappa for m raters. A data frame with 30 observations (psychiatric diagnoses with levels 1. Depression, 2. Personality
# Disorder, 3. Schizophrenia, 4. Neurosis, 5. Other) on 6 variables representing different raters.
